### Hi there, I'm Hyunwoo Kim ðŸ‘‹

## 
- Figure out best&worst practices (by asking "Why?"), and publishing them as [Terraform best practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com) and [Terragrunt Reference Architecture](https://github.com/antonbabenko/terragrunt-reference-architecture)
- Open-source, Terraform and AWS
- Live streaming is fun, too.


## Some of my open-source projects

- [Terraform AWS modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules) which were provisioned more than 15 million times.
- [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) to keep Terraform projects clean and nice.
